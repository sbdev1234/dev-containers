# dev-containers

Configuration boiler-plates for my dev-containers.

## Usage

Each type of dev container uses a local base-image. Avoiding the need to publish them, and avoiding slow dev-container builds.

## Installation

Clone repo and run the build script from within the desired base-image folder.

### Assumptions

Docker is installed.
